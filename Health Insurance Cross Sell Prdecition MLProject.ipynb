Accurately predicting customer interest in vehicle insurance enables the insurance company to strategically target customers with high conversion potential, optimizing marketing efforts, communication strategies, and overall revenue generation.\n","\n","**Business Context**:\n","\n","Insurance is fundamentally a risk-sharing agreement where customers pay a periodic premium to protect themselves from potential financial loss due to health, vehicle damage, or other events. In the case of health insurance, customers pay a regular premium in exchange for coverage on medical expenses such as hospitalizations, surgeries, and medication. Similarly, vehicle insurance covers the cost of damage repair, liability, and other expenses in case of accidents. A company that provides both types of insurance has a unique opportunity to cross-sell vehicle insurance to its existing health insurance policyholders.\n","\n","In this scenario, the company seeks to determine which of its health insurance customers would be most likely to buy vehicle insurance. Identifying these customers can help the company direct marketing and sales efforts more efficiently, improving customer acquisition and retention rates.\n","\n","Approach to Model Building To achieve the prediction objective, the following steps will be taken:\n","\n","**Data Preprocessing**:\n","\n","This involves cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features. Ensuring that the data is in a format suitable for model training is crucial.\n","\n","**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**\n","\n","EDA will help identify patterns and relationships in the data, providing insights into customer behavior and the factors that influence interest in vehicle insurance.\n","\n","**Model Selection**:\n","\n","Several machine learning algorithms will be evaluated, including:\n","\n","Logistic Regression Decision Trees Random Forests Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) These algorithms will be tested to determine which offers the best balance of accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.\n","\n","**Model Evaluation**:\n","\n","The model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Cross-validation will be employed to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the data.\n","\n","**Optimization**:\n","\n","Hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques will be applied to optimize the modelâ€™s performance.\n","\n","**Expected Outcome**:\n","\n","The outcome of this project is a predictive model that can help the insurance company identify the health insurance customers who are most likely to purchase vehicle insurance. This will enable the company to target its marketing efforts more effectively, improving customer conversion rates and maximizing revenue."],"metadata":{"id":"FJNUwmbgGyua"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The insurance company, which currently provides health insurance to a significant number of customers, is seeking to expand its offerings by cross-selling vehicle insurance.

The model should leverage available customer data, including demographics, vehicle information, and current policy details, to predict interest in vehicle insurance.

High precision ensures that marketing resources are focused on customers with a higher likelihood of purchasing.\n","\n","**F1** **Score**: The F1 score balances recall and precision, which is valuable when both false positives and false negatives are important. Since insurance marketing involves both converting the right customers (precision) and reaching as many potential customers as possible (recall), the F1 score is an ideal metric to assess overall effectiveness.\n","\n","**AUC (Area Under the Curve)**: AUC provides a broad measure of a model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.

Maximizing Customer Reach (High Recall):\n","\n","With a recall of 99.6%, the model ensures that nearly all potential customers who are likely to be interested in vehicle insurance are captured. This reduces the risk of missing out on potential sales opportunities. Efficient Targeting (High Precision):\n","\n","A precision of 90.7% indicates that most of the customers the model predicts as likely to buy vehicle insurance are indeed interested. This minimizes wasted marketing efforts on customers who are unlikely to convert, making marketing campaigns more cost-effective. Balanced Marketing Strategy (F1 Score):\n","\n","The F1 score of 94.9% shows that the model strikes a good balance between identifying many potential customers (recall) and ensuring that those identified are genuinely likely to convert (precision). This balance is crucial for optimizing both customer acquisition and marketing efficiency. Feature Importance:\n","\n","By using tools like SHAP, the model's feature importance analysis revealed key factors driving customer interest in vehicle insurance. For example, demographic features like age and income may play a significant role, along with vehicle-related characteristics. This insight helps tailor marketing efforts to the right customer segments, improving conversion rates. Strategic Decision-Making (AUC Score):\n","\n","With an AUC of 95.1%, the model shows strong capability in distinguishing between customers likely to buy vehicle insurance and those who are not, regardless of the chosen decision threshold. This allows flexibility in adjusting the threshold based on marketing goals, such as reaching a broader audience or focusing on more likely buyers."],"metadata":{"id":"Fjb1IsQkh3yE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### ***Hurrah!
