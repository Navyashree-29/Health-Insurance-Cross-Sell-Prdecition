# Health-Insurance-Cross-Sell-Predecition

# Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an existing insurance policyholder will be interested in purchasing an additional vehicle insurance policy (cross-sell). The classification model will analyze customer attributes to predict their likelihood of opting for a new product offering, allowing the insurance company to better target potential cross-sell opportunities.

# Project Type: Classification

# Key Steps:

# Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gather and clean the data related to existing customers, including demographic information, policy details, vehicle information, and insurance history.
Handle missing values, perform feature scaling, and encode categorical variables where necessary.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze the distribution of data, correlations, and patterns among variables.
Visualize customer attributes and their relationship with the target variable (whether the customer opted for the cross-sell).
# Feature Engineering:

Extract new features from the raw data that may improve model performance.
Evaluate the importance of features in relation to the target variable using statistical techniques and domain knowledge.
# Model Building:

Implement classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks.
Train and validate the models using techniques like k-fold cross-validation.
# Model Evaluation:

Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.
Select the best model based on its performance metrics and the ability to generalize on unseen data.
# Model Tuning and Optimization:

Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to improve model performance.
Use methods like feature selection and regularization to avoid overfitting.
# Deployment:

Integrate the final model into a production environment where it can make real-time predictions on new customer data.
